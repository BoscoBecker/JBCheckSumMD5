# Features
* Supports almost all Windows platforms, including Microsoft Windows 95, 98, 2000, Me, XP, 2003, Vista and Windows 7.
* Fast and multi-threaded. You can calculate a 2 GB file in less than 1 minute.

* Supports large files over 4 GB.
* Low use of resources. Uses less than 5 MB of RAM.
* Does not require the .NET runtime installed. It is a stand-alone EXE file and initialization is fast.
* Supports checking the original MD5 value and the current MD5 value.
* Most importantly, it's free. No spyware or adware packages.
* Small size, an effective and tiny tool for data security.


# About checksum

Checksum or checksum is a code used to check the
 integrity of data transmitted over a channel with
noise or stored in some medium for some time.

# Operation

This is done by calculating the checksum of the data before
of shipping or storing them,
and recalculate them when receiving or retrieving them from
storage.
If the value obtained is the same, the information has not suffered
changes and therefore are not corrupted.

More simplified forms of these sums are vulnerable because
fail to detect some forms of failure.
The simple sum of the character values ​​for example is
vulnerable to changing their order for commutativity of the sum.
There are more elaborate ways of calculating these sums that
solve these problems, such as the Cyclic Redundancy Check
cyclic redundancy) or CRC widely used for fault detection by splitting
of polynomials.

# About MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5)

MD5 is a cryptographic dispersion function
 128-bit (or cryptographic hash function) unidirectional
developed by RSA Data Security, Inc., described in RFC 1321, and very
used by software with a point-to-point protocol
 (P2P, or Peer-to-Peer, in English) in health check
files and logins.
